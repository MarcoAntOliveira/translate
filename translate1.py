Numerical simulation can provide more data and details to
better understand the impact process, and can also serve as a
supplement to experiments to save research costs. Therefore, nu-
merical simulation was widely used in the design and evaluation of
space debris shield structure. Previously, the numerical simulation
of traditional metal materials was relatively simple, the modeling
methods and material parameters were relatively mature, and the
numerical simulation results and experimental results had good
consistency. With the emergence of more and more new materials,
complex microstructures, diverse compositional materials, and
unknown material parameters all pose new challenges to accurate
numerical simulations.
As shown in Fig. 33, the development of new materials requires
more advanced numerical simulation methods to improve
computational accuracy and efficiency. Initially, the Finite Element
Method (FEM) was applied to hypervelocity impact, such as the
Lagrange algorithm [279,280] and Euler algorithm [281,282].
Lagrange has significant advantages in grid partitioning, compu-
tational feeiciency, and identifying fragment boundaries, but de-
leting the mesh to overcome large material deformation can result
in significant discrepancies between the calculated and experi-
mental results. The Euler algorithm can solve large deformation
problems, but it needs to face problems such as material fracture
and fragment boundary identification. CTH [283e285] is a code
based on Euler algorithm for modeling large-deformation and
strong shock problems in multiple dimensions and with multiple
kinds of materials, and it is not able to treat non-eroding penetra-
tion/perforation problems very well. The ALE algorithm [286]
combines Lagrange and Euler algorithms, but there was a problem
of complex mixed grids.
In order to overcome the shortcomings of FEM, meshless
method was widely used to solve the energy and mass loss prob-
lems caused by large deformations in hypervelocity impact. The
early development of meshless method can be traced back to
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) by Lucy [287], Gingold and
Monaghan [288] for astrophysics modeling. The SPH algorithm,
page 28
after multiple improvements, has been widely applied in research
related to explosions and high velocity impacts. The SPH method
solves the mesh distortion, but the large number of particles in the
complex structure reduces the computational efficiency, especially
facing the large scale differences between projectiles and targets. In
addition, SPH also has the problem that the debris boundary is not
easy to identify [289]. The material point method (MPM) is another
particle kind meshless method proposed by Sulsky [290]. It uses
particle discrete objects, is not limited by mesh distortion, and is
easy to describe the fracture of materials [291]. Compared with
Lagrange and Euler method, the MPM method is more advanta-
geous when dealing with impact and penetration problems
[292,293].
The FEM-SPH adaptive coupling algorithm [294,295] was
page29
proposed to solve the problems of material loss, large material
deformation, and fragment boundary recognition, which replaces
failed FEM elements with SPH particles to continue participating in
calculations, and is currently being increasingly applied as a
method. When materials have not failed, they are solved by the
FEM, which provides suitable material models and equations of
state for anisotropic materials. Failure materials, whose anisotropic
properties can be ignored, are adequately represented by SPH
particles [296e300]. Therefore, the FEM-SPH adaptive method is
suitable for simulating anisotropic materials, but it is necessary to
set appropriate loss criteria and additional adaptive transformation
algorithms.
Many kinds of numerical simulation methods have been
developed for sandwich panel hypervelocity impact, as shown in
Fig. 34. The numerical simulation of hypervelocity impact of foam
sandwich panels simulated by two methods of SPH and Lagrange
was compared by Nitta [301], and Deconinck [72] converted the
failed Lagrangian elements into SPH particles to ensure mass con-
servation and limit the step size drop at the contact interface. Chen
[302] developed a new engineering model, and the honeycomb
core was equaled to multi-parallel thin plates, which can represent
the discontinuity of honeycomb core without complex boundary.
The impact on honeycomb sandwich panel is essentially three-
dimensional, especially for oblique incidence impacts that require
three-dimensional modeling and analysis [65,69]. However, it is
reasonable to simplify the honeycomb sandwich panel to a two-
dimensional model when only considering the normal impact, as
the central fragment is mostly occurring phenomenon, leading to
the damage of the back facesheet at normal incidence impact. Due
to the computational cost and the concentration characteristics of
debris clouds along the impact direction in normal collisions, two-
dimensional axisymmetric simulation is sufficient to study the
main physical phenomena [303]. Chen [304] used the adaptive al-
gorithm coupled with FEM and SPH to calculate the hypervelocity
impact of projectile on the honeycomb sandwich panel, converting
the failed elements into particles, which can describe the move-
ment of debris clouds and predict the damage of the honeycomb
sandwich panel well.
Zhang [305] proposed a Fractal Theory and Node-separation
FEM to simulate the hypervelocity impact on foam sandwich
panel. The Voronoi modeling technique is already used in the
studies of crushing response simulations of the foam material. The
beam element is used to model the ligaments in the open cell foam
[306]; the shell element is used to model the walls in the close cell
foam [307]; and the tetrahedron solid element is used in the foam
model derived from the CT (Computed Tomography) scan [308].
However, all the three element types are not feasible in the hy-
pervelocity impact simulation. Zhang [309,310] coupled the Vor-
onoi technique with the SPH method that is widely used for
hypervelocity impact simulation. The voronoi tessellation method
was used to model explicitly the cellular geometry, and the beam
element was used to model the ligaments in the open cell foam.
page30
Then the cores of the cells are first generated by packing random
spheres into the specified spatial domain, the weighted voronoi
tessellation is then applied to make the cellular structure of the
foam material, and hypervelocity impact simulation is conducted
method combining the SPH and finite element reconstruction (FER)
in LS-dyna. Cherniaev [311] obtained a realistic foam geometry
model using X-ray computed tomography imaging, and conversed
it to a meshless SPH model suitable for hypervelocity impact sim-
ulations. Ma [312,313] produced the metallic foam using space-
holding filler method, and three-dimensional SPH code for simu-
lations of foams was developed.
As shown in Fig. 35, the delamination of fiber laminates, the 3D
orthogonal woven microstructure micro model, and the non-
circular fiber bundle interface are the difficulties in numerical
simulation of fiber composite materials. The simulation of fiber
composite materials was often calculated using SPH or FEM
[314,315], and treating each layer of material as a homogeneous
material without considering the anisotropy of each phase mate-
rial. The numerical simulation of fiber composite materials
considering the preparation of three-dimensional material micro-
scopic models has solved the problem of simplistic conventional
models, greatly improving calculation accuracy. The application of
SPH-FEM coupling algorithm has solved the problem of fiber
bundle distortion and difficulty in identifying fragments in the
calculation process of fiber materials [223,316e319]. For numerical
simulation model of fiber composite material, the model size needs
to meet the actual needs of aerospace engineering and retain the
main structural characteristics of the actual material, ignoring
secondary factors, and minimizing the number of units and
improving the quality of units as much as possible.
The numerical simulation of ceramic materials usually adopts
FEM or SPH calculation [320e322]. The difficulty of simulation is to
select the constitutive relationship and material parameters that
determine the damage initiation, damage evolution, material
strength degradation due to damage [163], crack initiation and
crack propagation. Reasonable simulation of crack initiation,
propagation, and branching requires a suitable numerical frame-
work. Most of the determination of constitutive relationship pa-
rameters depends on the experimental results observed after
impact, while ignoring the data during impact.
Material model of bumper for orbital debris protection is shown
in Table 1. The selection of material models has a crucial influence
on numerical simulation results, including strength models and
equations of state (EOS).
The commonly used strength models include ideal elastic-
plastic model, Johnson-Cook (JC) model, and Steinberg-Guinan
(SG) model [323e325]. The JC model is a description of the
stress-strain relationship that considers the effects of strain hard-
ening, strain rate hardening, and heat softening, and the JC model is
widely considered suitable for low velocity impacts with low strain
page31
rates. Hauhurst and Livingstone's research [326] shows that the
EOS is most critical in hypervelocity impact simulation, and the
strength models have no significant effect on the development of
phenomenon induced by hypervelocity impact. Therefore, the JC
model still achieved good results in a large number of simulations
of hypervelocity impacts. The SG model emphasizes the influence
of pressure and temperature on the shear modulus and yield
strength, and is more suitable for high strain rates than the JC
model. For Fiber fabrics, the orthotropic models have to be used
[327]. Fibers, such as Kevlar, Nextel, UHMWPE and other fibers, as
the fundamental component in the fabric, are the anisotropic ma-
terials with linear elastic properties along the fiber axis and
nonlinear inelastic properties in transverse direction. In anisotropic
materials, the traditional independent approach for the solution of
the strongly coupled EOS and strength models is complicated, as
deviatoric strain leads to hydrostatic pressure and volumetric strain
leads to deviatoric stress. The material model for fabric subjected to
hypervelocity impact was developed based on a decoupled aniso-
tropic constitutive relationship to considering shock response
[319]. Johnson and Holmquist [328] proposed three models to
predict spalling, formation of conoid, fragmentation and crack
branching in the ceramic under dynamic load, namely Johnson-
Holmquist I (JH1) and II (JH2) and the Johnson-Holmquist Bissel
(JHB). The JH1 model used piecewise linear segments to describe
the material strength and failure behavior, which suddenly change
based on hydrostatic pressure and damage evolution. The JH2
page 33
model used continuous curves to represent dimensionless strength
and damage, and sudden changes in strength and damage may
represent a realistic description of the response of the brittle ma-
terials like ceramic. In the JHB model, the strength and damage are
represented by analytic curves but changes in the material strength
and damage with sudden jumps. Although the predicted results of
JH1, JH2, and JHB ceramic material models are qualitatively similar,
the JH1 and JHB provide results that are closer to the experimental
results in terms of the spall plane in the flyer plate impact tests and
the crack patterns and the conoid zone for the penetration prob-
lems [163]. For the description of the behavior of hypervelocity
impact, such as debris cloud motion, bumper perforation, rear wall
damage, both the predicted results of JH2 and JH1 have good
consistency with the experimental results [144,169,172].
The EOS is a function that describes the relationship between
pressure, density, and temperature of the material under the shock.
Especially under strong load caused by hypervelocity impact, the
impact pressure is much higher than the material strength, which
lead to the weak strength effect in the initial stage of the impact,
and the EOS plays the decisive role [326]. The strength effect
gradually becomes apparent in the later stage of the impact. The
Mie-Grüneisen EOS [281] can accurately describe the material dy-
namic behavior of solid metals under high temperature, high
pressure, and high strain rate conditions. After modifying its pa-
rameters, it can also describe metals in liquid and gas phases. The
Tillotson EOS [329] was constructed by combining the Thomas-
Fermi model and the ideal gas model, and can describe the solid-
gas transition. The compression and expansion states of mate-
rials, encompassing the solid, liquid, and gas phases, were depict by
two complex forms, but ignores the melting and vaporization. The
Gray EOS [330] has a simpler analytical expression, and it can
provide a broad description of the phase transition, including solid,
liquid, and gas states, as well as the two-phase regions of melting
and vaporization.
